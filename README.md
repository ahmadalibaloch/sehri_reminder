Sehri Reminder

## Getting Started

A reminder app which reminds for a selected number of times before actual time of Sahri (Sahur) or Iftar.

Open source plugins used are:

-   flutter_form_builder
-   path_provider
-   android_alarm_manager
-   flutter_tts
-   flutter_local_notifications

The idea is to remind user before the event. Use can select 5 minutes, 10 minutes and so on as the pre reminders of the event. It is very useful for Sehri and Iftar in Ramadan when meal preparations need to be finalized.
